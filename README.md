# Statbomb Open Data Project For Norwich

A project to figure out the best ball-playing center backs from the 2018 World Cup Data of Statsbomb Open Data Repository.

The Codes Directory has all the notebooks. The Data directory has all the datafiles - the raw event data file as well the datafiles containing the extracted metrics. The Visualizations directory has all the images plus the presentation. The Results directory has some preliminary results I was keeping track of as a mark of progress.
